// preferred client to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure,
// scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative
// (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this API. For
// information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see [Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference].
